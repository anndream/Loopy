Loopy is an audio player dedicated to seamlessly looping audio files
It can basically loop every audio file you have in your media library.

Loopy is not an audio editor, so the loops you want to use should already be prepared and edited properly, if you need exact results.

If you use Loopy's "Wait until finished" you can use Loopy as a very simple live composition tool. It allows you to pre-select what loop to switch to after the current one finishes, so with a prepared set of loops you can put them together on-the-fly.

Loopy is free and open source. It is released under the Apache 2.0 License.
