# Loopy
### Android app written in Kotlin to manage and play audio loops
It's only purpose is to provide a solution to those who just want to play audio files in loop, like DJs, artists, musicians, who can use this for easy training sessions, to provide gapless background atmosphere or play neverending beat loops. It is not the only app capable of this, but it is the one I made :-)

NOTE: There is no in-app editing or anything like that, so if you need exact loop files, you should prepare them elsewhere! It's not an audio editor. Loopy can only handle the playback.

This is a work in progress right now, but it can be used already. Just pull the repository and build it to your phone using Android Studio or your preferred method. 

Usage is simple: Browse your phone's folders and pick audio files. Then play them from the player view and they'll loop seamlessly. It's capable of playing back .wav, .mp3 and .ogg files so far.
